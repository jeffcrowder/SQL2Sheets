# SQL2Sheets
This is my attempt to create a program that connects a local SQL database to a Google sheet using the API. 
Right now this is a noob program that is a learning, work in progress.

TODO
1. Make this Object Oriented.
2. Add the backgroundworker thread and implement worker_DoWork method and worker_RunWorkerCompleted.
3. Add functionality to have the projects update at a specified rate. Ex once per day.....
4. Have the active list of projects showing status in the DataGrid on activity tab
5. Add ability to dynamically create and destroy projects.
6. Give user ability to update projects using either batchupdate or append methods.
7. Add some level of error checking in the user input fields
8. Make this program run as a service
9. Add more exception handling
10. Clean up the credentials
11. Can I turn this into a web based application that runs with the local SQL server?
